title: Smart check-in system for the office

description: 
  - This template allows employees to check in and out quickly and easily to document their presence in the office. The overview shows at a glance who is in the office that day – especially useful for companies with a strong remote work culture. Check-in takes place via a second view where employees can select their name from a dropdown menu and check in. The check-out process is just as simple – a single click on the user’s profile picture in the overview is all it takes to check out. Download the template for free and adapt it to the specific needs of your company. For example, the check-in process could also be implemented using an RFID reader and employee ID badge for an even faster and more automated solution.
