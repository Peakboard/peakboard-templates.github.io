# Possible Data Sources
This template uses OPC UA as the source of machine data. Therefore, it is ideally suited for integration with the solution from [Softing](https://www.peakboard.com/en/partnership/softing). The OPC UA server from Softing captures and standardizes data from a wide range of PLC manufacturers and collects it centrally. Especially for larger production environments, an OPC UA server proves to be extremely beneficial, as it minimizes the demand load by allowing Peakboard to access only the central server instead of individual machine controls.
