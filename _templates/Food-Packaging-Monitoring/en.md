title: Packaging line monitoring for the food industry

description: 
  - This template provides a comprehensive overview of the current status of a packaging system in food production. As a central monitoring dashboard, it enables real-time tracking of production progress, machine status, and material availability. In addition to comparing actual and target production quantities per line, the dashboard clearly displays the status of open or critical quality checks. It also visualizes the operational status of all machines across the individual packaging lines – allowing potential issues or downtimes to be detected early and resolved quickly.
  - The dashboard is complemented by the display of fill levels, both for the central raw material bunker and for line-specific containers, such as seasoning hoppers in this example. This solution is ideal for companies in the food industry that aim to create transparency in their packaging processes and significantly reduce reaction times in the event of deviations.
