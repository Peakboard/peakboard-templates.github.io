title: Your interactive production tracking dashboard â€“ easily track the progress of manufacturing processes
description: 
  - This template is based on a SQL database and shows the current status of a machine in real time. This allows employees to track their progress in the production process and has the possibility to mark completed work steps as finished using a touch screen. When the touch screen is operated, the template writes back to the SQL database via a script and thus reports the completion of a work step. Download the template as an easy monitoring tool of your processes and a handy real-time overview over your progress!

# possible data sources

This template uses a SQL database. It also shows how to write back data into a database. But other systems could be used as well, such as ODBC, MS SQL Server, MS Access, MS Azure SQL, Oracle Database, IBM DB2, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Teradata or Wintool. An ERP system could also be suitable for this. A list of possible data sources can be found [here](https://peakboard.com/en/interfaces/).
