title: Optimized warehouse logistics - interactive dashboard for forklifts
description: 
  - This template was specifically designed for use on a forklift touchscreen and significantly optimizes drivers' workflows. Drivers can conveniently log in to their vehicle and immediately receive a well structured list of open driving tasks. For better orientation, the application graphically displays the pick-up and destination locations on a map. In addition, the number of journeys required is always in sight. Particularly useful is that you can complete tasks with a comment or report issues directly, once finished. You can create new driving jobs via [this](https://templates.peakboard.com/Forklift-Driving-Jobs-Planner/en) application.

  - This dashboard for forklift drivers ensures more efficient communication and reduces delays in your warehouse logistics. You not only improve navigation for drivers, but also coordination. Without misunderstandings, you increase productivity in your warehouse and on the company premises.

  - Download the template for free and adapt it to your intralogistics requirements without any programming effort. To make it even easier to use, all scripts in this template were created with Peakboard Building Blocks, our low-code scripting editor.
