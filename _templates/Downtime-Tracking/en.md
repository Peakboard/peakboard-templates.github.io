title: Downtime Tracking in Real-Time â€“ Efficient Overview of Machine Data
description: 
- With this template, you can effectively monitor and manage machine downtimes in real-time. The template uses OPC UA to gather critical machine data, which is seamlessly stored in a Peakboard Hub list. Downtimes are presented as a time-sorted list of states by machine or workstation, including the timestamp, current state, justification (if applicable), and the duration of the downtime.
- This information is visualized in a bar histogram, providing a clear overview of downtimes and enabling you to identify patterns and areas for improvement. You can easily edit downtimes directly within the template and add reasons for each instance, ensuring that your team has the context needed for effective troubleshooting. By displaying relevant metrics on your screens, you enhance transparency in your production processes, reduce unexpected downtimes, and ultimately maximize your operational efficiency. Download now and take the first step towards a more streamlined production environment!

# Possible data sources
This template utilizes OPC UA for machine data integration and connects to Peakboard Hub lists to store and track downtime history. To tailor the template to your specific requirements, various other machine data sources, such as MQTT or S7 Protocol can be incorporated.
The machine data is stored in [Peakboard Hub](https://peakboard.com/en/product/peakboard-hub/) lists. Additionally, MES systems can also be connected for more comprehensive monitoring.You can also incorporate basic data through standards like XML, MongoDB, JSON, and Excel. Explore the various options available to ensure your system is compatible. If you need assistance with additional integrations, feel free to reach out! 

# Further screens
The application offers an easy way edit and add descriptions to downtimes.
