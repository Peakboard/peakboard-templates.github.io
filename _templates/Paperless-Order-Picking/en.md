title: Paperless order picking - Warehouse logistics with tablet, digital scales, and label printer

description: 
  - This template demonstrates the use of two Peakboard applications in your logistics company. An open order can be selected on a tablet. A barcode scanner is used to process the item list for the order and compile the order. Once all items have been scanned, the employee can proceed to a scale. This is where the second application comes in, which compares the weight on the scale with the weight of the order in real time. The label for the package is then printed.
  - To enable you to test the template without external devices, we have included buttons that simulate the functions of the scale and barcode scanner.
