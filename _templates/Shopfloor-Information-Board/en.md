title: Digital bulletin board for more efficient communication on your shop floor
description: 
  - This interactive digital bulletin board clearly displays all important information and key production figures relating to your production. In addition, the application not only allows you to create but also edit shift schedules for your team for the current and the coming week. All employees can be assigned a shift, workstation, and an order to be processed for each business day. The digital production dashboard is operated either with a touchscreen or with a mouse and keyboard, which is easy to connect to the Peakboard Box.
  - This digital solution also makes having to physically print out and post important notices or the weekly menu a thing of the past. With Peakboard, just load the PDF documents to be displayed on a network drive, SharePoint, or OneDrive, for example. You can easily swap out the files to be displayed as needed. The digital bulletin board will then update the display fully automatically.
  - Download the template now and customize it to your individual needs without any IT effort or previous knowledge. Our [consulting team](https://peakboard.com/produkt/consulting/) would also be happy to assist.

# Possible data sources
This template uses a Peakboard Hub list as the central data source. The data is entered with a mouse and keyboard connected to the Peakboard Box or a touchscreen and written to a Peakboard Hub list, which is then read for data visualization. As an alternative, you can use other databases for this, such as SQL, Oracle, or ODBC. The master data, such as the names of the team members and the workstations in the company, can also be maintained in a list in Peakboard Hub and read from there. To use this template with your own Peakboard Hub, you can download the table structure for a shift schedule <a href="Template_Shopfloor_Information_Board_Schedule.csv" class="inline" download>here</a>, an employee list  <a href="Template_Shopfloor_Information_Board_Staff.csv" class="inline" download>here</a>, and a workstation structure <a href="Template_Shopfloor_Information_Board_Workstations.csv" class="inline" download>here</a>. Import these into your Peakboard Hub and then adjust the data sources in the template accordingly.
