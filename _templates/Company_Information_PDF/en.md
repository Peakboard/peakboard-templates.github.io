title: Digital employee information board with PDF display

description: 
  - This template replaces the traditional paper bulletin board and offers an interactive and flexible digital solution for displaying important company information. The board shows the two most recent shift schedules, the cafeteria menu, and various other company updates. The corresponding PDF files are directly uploaded into the file system on the Peakboard Hub and then displayed on the board. Employees can access the information at any time and navigate interactively through the different categories. After a defined period of inactivity, the board automatically switches between different announcements. This solution ensures a clear, user-friendly, and always up-to-date presentation of company data, enabling efficient information distribution without the need for paper printing and distribution.
