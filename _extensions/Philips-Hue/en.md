description: 
  - With this extension you can connect devices from the Philips Hue lighting system via the Hue Bridge as a data source in Peakboard. The data source lets you read or write back data about the state (on / off) as well as the brightness value of each applied light source. This way, Peakboard can be used to easily create an interactive dashboard for controlling Philips Hue lighting.
